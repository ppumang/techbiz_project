As a method of continuing the high drug permeation, it is used an unique hydrophilic polymer system in which the drug can be contained in a high concentration under no water environment, a solubility of the hydrophobic drug is decreased as the water is introduced to the patch from the skin, so that the drug is maintained at the saturation concentration even though the drug content is decreased as the drug is permeated to the skin. During the application of the transdermal preparation to the skin, it is possible to continuously permeate the high amount of drug, to maintain the sufficient adhesion during the use and to minimize the skin side effect, because the hydrophilic polymer absorbs the water from the skin. The hydrophilic polymer system can serve the function thereof through the hydrophobic adhesive layer capable of preventing the water quickly absorbed from the skin from being evaporated to the outside of the patch.","소수성 약물을 함유하는 경피 제제가 개시된다. 높은 약물 투과를 지속하는 방법으로는 물 환경이 아닌 상태에서 고농도로 약물을 담을 수 있는 독특한 친수성 고분자 시스템을 사용하고, 물이 패치에 유입됨에 따라 소수성 약물의 용해도가 저하되어 약물이 피부에 투과됨에 따라 약물 함량이 감소하더라도 포화 농도로 약물을 유지한다. 피부에 경피 제제를 적용하는 동안 다량의 약물을 지속적으로 투과시키고, 사용 중에 충분한 접착력을 유지하고, 친수성 고분자가 피부의 수분을 흡수하기 때문에 피부 부작용을 최소화 할 수 있습니다. 친수성 고분자 시스템은 소수성 접착층으로 그 기능을 수행 할 수 있어 피부로부터 빠르게 흡수되는 물이 패치 외부로 증발되는 것을 방지 할 수 있다.","Pacific Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.","Seoul , KR","","KR","PACIFIC PHARMACEUTICAL CO LTD","Choi; Yang Gyu|Ah; Young Chang|Choi; Woo Jeong|Kim; Jung Ju","KR|KR|KR|KR","A61K-009/70","A61K9/7061, A61K31/00, A61K31/19, A61K31/192, A61K31/196","424/449","US12/084014","2006.10.23","US20090252782A1","2009.10.08","","","US8728514","2014.05.20","KR 10-2005-0100164 (2005.10.24)","PCTKR2006004330","2006.10.23","WO2007049892","2007.05.03","CN101370487A, CN101370487B, EP1951211A1, EP1951211A4, EP1951211B1, EP1951211B2, KR100663163B1, US2009252782A1, US8728514B2, WO2007049892A1","CN101370487A, CN101370487B, EP1951211A1, EP1951211A4, EP1951211B1, EP1951211B2, KR100663163B1, US2009252782A1, US8728514B2, WO2007049892A1","Liu; Sue|Kassa; Jessica","Merchant & Gould P.C.","","1","10","1.
